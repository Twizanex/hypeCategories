============
www.hypeJunction.com

hypeJunction is here for you to connect, innovate, integrate, collaborate and indulge.

hypeJunction is a bundle of plugins that will help you kick start your Elgg-based social network and spice it up with cool features and functionalities.


For best performance of the individual plugins within the hypeJunction bundle you require hypeFramework plugin that builds a visual framework around the functionality of the bundled plugins. Standalone plugins contain the functional code, but will not always render properly for visual interaction without the hypeFramework.

hypeFramework may be obtained at www.elgg.org or www.hypeJunction.com. I request you to kindly consider a donation to help me maintain the demo servers and continue GPL development.
Technical Support will only be available at commercial rates. I will only respond to how-to questions and feature requests that come from the members of the hypeJunction Club (see below).

Alternatively, you can obtain hypeJunction Club Membership for a one-time membership fee of 250 Euro (the fee will be raising with the new plugins being added). For now, no annual renewal fees.
Club membership entitles you to:
- Access to all publicly released GPL and premium plugins within the hypeJunction
- Multi-site license for premium plugins
- Access to unreleased plugins within the hypeJunction
- Access to all new GPL and premium plugins to be released within the hypeJunction
- 2 hours of free technical support to help you set-up and customize the hypeJunction Bundle on your site
- Discounted rates for paid technical support
- Ability to request features (your voice will be heard)
- Access to a how-to section and user manuals (to be set up)
